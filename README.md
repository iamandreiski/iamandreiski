## About @iamandreiski
I'm an independent security researcher with two **top 5** finishes in contests across Code4rena and CodeHawks, with 15+ H/M confirmed. 
Professionally I've worked for 5+ years in the Blockchain space, experience which includes managerial positions at one of the top Crypto Exchanges. 

The evergrowing need for the improvement of smart contract security is what motivated me to become a part of the web3 security space a year ago. 
I've been competing in public contests since January 2024, and have already ranked in the Top 50 SR's on CodeHawks (All time), and Top 100 on Code4rena (90 Days).

You can find me at **@iamandreiski** on Twitter, Telegram, and Discord.
